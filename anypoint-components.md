# Anypoint Partner Manager

## What is?
Is a low-code integration solution, that enables B2B (business to business) integration over HTTP, but typically uses industry standards to exchange
data such as EDI, or AS2, X12 or EDIFACT data.

# Why - Use Case
It's an easy-to-use solution, with a low entry-barrier for all users, that can create integration for specialized use cases that rely on EDIFACT or AS2 formats.
Provides a simplified UI to create the solution, especially for partners for the company, that need to exchange data or get event based notifications.
It's an alternative to mule development, the same could be achieve with a mule app, but this is simpler.

# Anypoint CLI

## What is?
Is the command line interface for interacting with the anypoint platform services (runtime manager, api manager, governance, etc).
Runs in the terminal/command line.

# Why - Use Case
DevOPS teams need to automate and interact with the platform without a User Interface (UI).
Enables the automation of deployments, can apply policies at deployment time, execute API specification governance audits,
set up alerts, download logs and much more.
